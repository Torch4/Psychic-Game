First and foremost, let me say that I am having a HORRIBLE time with Java but I am willing to learn and try :) The main purpose of this program is to be a Random Letter Guessing Game in which the computer generates a random letter and the user must guess up to 4 times of what the letter is. It's also intended to dictate whether the users guess comes before or after the computers letter alphabetically.

I'm mainly wondering if any of the code is correct or not so far... My next problem lies in what I should do next.. I was thinking about a comparison loop of Character vs the Input, but I can't seem to figure out how to give strings integer values.

        int character = (int) (Math.random() * 52);

        String alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
14
        String letter = alphabet.substring(character, character+1);

        System.out.println("The purpose of this program is to play a guessing game." + "\nIn the game the computer picks a random capital letter (A - Z)" + "and the player is given up to four tries to guess the letter." + "\nThe player may input either a lower or a upper case letter." + "\nOnce a game is over the program asks if additional games are" + "to be played. \nWhen no more games are to be played a total" + "score of wins for the computer and the player is displayed.");
